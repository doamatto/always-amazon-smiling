# Always Amazon Smiling

Always Amazon Smiling is a simple extension to redirect all requests from Amazon sites (where applicable) to the appropriate Amazon Smile instances. This allows you to easily support the charities (or non-profits) that you love.

Always Amazon Smiling never saves or shares your URLs. All processing of the Amazon URL is done on your computer and is never sent to me to be sold or collected. I don't want to know that you've bought 52 different Barbie dolls in the past year because why would I waste drive space on that kind of thing when I can waste it on games and code.
